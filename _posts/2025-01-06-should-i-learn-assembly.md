title: "Should I learn assembly?"

Well, I already made the decision. I am learning assembly! Is this a good use of my time? In this post, I'll explain some reasons why this is a bad idea.

But first, some background.

## What is assembly?

Assembly is a family of very low level programming languages, that 

## You should not learn assembly.

**1. It's abstracted away.**

Today the majority of developers will barely ever see, let alone write, a single line of assembly. Instead we build applications at a much higher level, most likely using an interpreted language, such as JavaScript, Java or Python, that doesn't even map directly to assembly intstructions. Whether we are working on a user interface, a backend service, or a database, the idea of moving data physically in and out of registers in a running CPU is mostly not relevant. Instead we may think more in terms of the document object model (DOM) of a webpage, a database schema or an API contract. The ability to express and operate with these concepts in programming languages is a technological marvel I think most people are pretty happy working at that high level where they can turn they ideas more easily into useful applications.

### There is an opportunity cost to learning it.

Assembly code is made of simple instructions, but getting anything interesting done with it is complex. Given the effort it would take to learn, wouldn't there be more value in learning something at a higher level? This has been the trend throughout Today the trend is clearly towards programming with the assistance of AI. More lines of code are being generated, less lines of code are being read. Great things can be achieved very quickly. Of course, there are drawbacks in this approach. AI assistants are great for greenfield projects, but they struggle with large entangled codebases, and even the most powerful agents still routinely write quite bad code. Basically, they don't know to carry out complex projects and they need guidance and guardrails. So instead we move towards developing those guardrails: spec driven development, better planning, automated code review, etc. As of today (September 6th 2025) this trend is likely to continue.

### Maybe assembly code is boring?

As I said above, it's very hard to do anything interesting with it. And what's interesting? Visual feedback is interesting. Applications are interesting. Seeing ideas come to life is interesting.
